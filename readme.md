amplify-blog
============

This is the backend of the blog hosted on [marek.rocks](https://marek.rocks). It's deployed using AWS Amplify and uses the Gatsby Starter Theme as a base. The blog content is retrieved using GraphQL from an AppSync endpoint. Searches are performed using Algolia Search.

The backend code for this web service can be found [here](https://github.com/marekq/rss-lambda).
