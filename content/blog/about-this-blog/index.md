I plan to share some common architectural patterns and best practices for serverless architectures on AWS here. You can expect blogs about the following topics;

* Building serverless pipelines with Lambda and Fargate using the CDK.
* Golang performance and tips and tricks for Lambda. 

The blog is built and deployed through AWS Amplify. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/marekq/amplify-blog).
